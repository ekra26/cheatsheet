# Codecademy Project: Build Your Own Cheat Sheet

## Introduction: 

In this project, Iâ€™ll be creating my own reference cheat sheet to help me build more websites in the future! 

I have decided to document CSS selectors and HTML tags to get started. The information will be displayed using HTML tables, a custom color scheme, and any other custom styles necessary to properly present the information to the user.
